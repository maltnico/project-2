/*
  # Fix security_settings table and profiles RLS recursion

  1. New Tables
    - `security_settings`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to profiles)
      - `settings` (jsonb)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `security_settings` table
    - Add policy for users to manage their own security settings
    - Fix infinite recursion in profiles RLS policies by removing problematic policies

  3. Changes
    - Drop all existing profiles policies that cause recursion
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies for profiles
    - Create security_settings table with proper RLS

-- Drop any functions that might be causing recursion

-- Create updated_at trigger for security_settings
