  # Fix properties table RLS policies

  1. Drop existing policies that may be using incorrect syntax
  2. Recreate all policies with correct auth.uid() function
  3. Ensure proper permissions for authenticated users

  This migration completely rebuilds the RLS policies for the properties table.

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own properties" ON properties;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own properties" ON properties;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own properties" ON properties;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own properties" ON properties;

-- Recreate policies with correct syntax
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own properties"
  ON properties

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own properties"

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own properties"

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own properties"
  ON properties
  FOR DELETE

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE properties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
